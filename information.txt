i decided to document all the crap i am putting on this project just so that i can re live the same moment once again when i read it again
well whatever i am working on the corr() betweeen the concepts of the datasets especially the network and the os as the irregularity on the datasets 
has caused me a great deal of tension

i should probably run a search through the dataset with a certain motive to make sure the datset is not too fancy

i would like it to generalize more and not be a master of the training session #kudos to overfitting-the real bitch 

im probably wondering what type of algo to use i could probably build a small one 

i do plan on popping some questionalbe rows myself tbh

here are the corr() between the os columns:
